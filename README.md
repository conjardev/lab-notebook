### What's it for?

Lab Notebook is my way of sharing what I'm doing and working on, without having to fit it in to a tweet or Git commit message. I wanted to share what I was working on without having to push a product with it, just so people can see the full detail behind some of my side projects.

Each article will include a little to a lot of information about something I've done in the past week, this could be big, like writing about the ongoing development of my blog, or working with APIs to create [Chatbot](https://labnotebook.connorjarrett.com/s/-13m6dmf?s=repo). Each one of my tweets and GitHub readmes will probably come linked with a blog post to describe in more detail what I've done.

### How often?

I hope to update quite regularly, I'm experimenting with a post a week, especially while it's new and unknown. This may slow down over time, but I definitely want to post when I release something big.
